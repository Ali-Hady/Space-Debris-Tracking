# space-debris-visualization
This is the result of work and research of team Mind Gravity, which participated in Nasa Space Apps Cairo 2021
I am a member of the team, and my role is full stack web development.
The project basically visualizes space debris using real time data and record.
The data was obtained by our backend model.
